# Career-Engineered Portfolio (NJIT)

## Live Site
(https://github.com/ms543-create/career---portfolio)

## Orchestration Log
The AI initially suggested using a backend contact form handler, but GitHub Pages only supports static hosting. I corrected the plan by switching to a static mailto-based CTA and kept the site lightweight for reliable deployment.

## Repo Contents
- README.md (human-facing overview)
- AGENTS.md (AI-facing strategy)
- index.html + style.css (site codebase)
